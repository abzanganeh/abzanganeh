## About Me

I’m a senior engineer with a background in QA automation, software development, and executive leadership. Over the past few years, I’ve transitioned into machine learning and data science through structured training and hands-on projects. My focus is on building reliable, interpretable ML systems and integrating them into real-world applications.

## Learning Journey

I’m completing Interview Kickstart’s AIML Software Engineering Program, which covers the full ML lifecycle. My learning approach combines theory, implementation, and project-based validation.

### Recently Completed
- Python for ML and data analysis  
- Pandas for feature engineering and statistical workflows  
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization  
- Supervised and unsupervised learning models (regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction)  
- Deep learning architectures including CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers (BERT, LLMs)  
- ML model deployment strategies and evaluation techniques  

### Currently Exploring
- Large Language Models (LLMs): fine-tuning, embeddings, and retrieval-augmented generation  
- NLP pipelines: tokenization, vectorization, semantic search  
- Prompt engineering and GenAI system design  
- Agentic AI frameworks: multi-step reasoning, tool use, and autonomous workflows  
- End-to-end ML application development with LLM integration  

## Featured Projects

- Built a responsive UI for user input and prediction output  
- Deployed a classification model with real-time feedback  
- Demonstrated end-to-end ML integration from training to deployment  

### [Churn Risk Intelligence](https://github.com/abzanganeh/churn_risk_intelligence)  
Predictive modeling for customer churn using structured telecom data.  
- Applied feature engineering and correlation analysis  
- Trained and evaluated multiple classifiers  
- Delivered actionable insights for retention strategies  

### [Bank Term Deposit Prediction](https://github.com/abzanganeh/bank-term-deposit-prediction)  
Binary classification model to predict term deposit subscriptions.  
- Explored imbalanced data handling and precision-recall tradeoffs  
- Used interpretable models like logistic regression and decision trees  
- Created visualizations to support business decision-making  

### [Signal Strength Classification](https://github.com/abzanganeh/signal_strength)  
Classified signal strength data using supervised learning techniques.  
- Cleaned and transformed raw signal data  
- Applied SVM and k-NN classifiers  
- Evaluated model performance using cross-validation  

### [Titanic Survival Analysis](https://github.com/abzanganeh/titanic_survival_analysis)  
Explored survival patterns using statistical analysis and feature engineering.  
- Handled missing data with imputation strategies  
- Created categorical variables for age and fare brackets  
- Visualized survival trends across demographics  

## Professional Background

I’ve led automation initiatives across web, mobile, and API platforms using Python, PyTest, Selenium, and Postman. My experience includes CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions and Jenkins, and testing ML-driven risk engines in identity security platforms. Prior to my technical career in the U.S., I held executive roles in fintech and manufacturing, where I applied econometric modeling and strategic planning to build and scale multimillion-dollar ventures.

## Career Timeline

- **2025**: Advanced ML fundamentals, GenAI, and portfolio development  
- **Fall 2025**: Capstone project completion  
- **Jan 2026**: Job search readiness for ML Researcher, ML Ops Engineer, and Prompt Engineer roles
