## About Me

I’m a senior engineer with a background in QA automation, software development, and executive leadership. Over the past few years, I’ve transitioned into machine learning and data science through structured training and hands-on projects. My focus is on building reliable, interpretable ML systems and integrating them into real-world applications.

## Current Learning Journey

I’m enrolled in Interview Kickstart’s AIML Software Engineering Program, progressing through modules that cover the full ML lifecycle—from Python fundamentals to scalable systems and GenAI integration. My learning approach combines theory, implementation, and project-based validation.

### Recently Completed
- Python for ML and data analysis  
- Pandas for feature engineering and statistical workflows  
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization  
- ML fundamentals and model deployment strategies  

### Currently Studying
- Ensemble methods and tree-based models  
- Model evaluation and optimization  
- Generative AI and prompt engineering  
- Linear algebra and statistical modeling  
- Scalable ML architecture and unsupervised learning  

### Upcoming Focus
- Neural networks and deep learning  
- Transformer-based NLP models  
- End-to-end ML applications with GenAI  
- Capstone project and portfolio completion
