## üéØ Featured Projects

**Titanic Survival Analysis Project**
Comprehensive statistical analysis of passenger survival patterns demonstrating end-to-end data science workflow capabilities. This project showcased proficiency in data cleaning and preprocessing, including strategic handling of missing values through median imputation for age data. The analysis revealed significant survival disparities across demographics, with women achieving 74% survival rates compared to 19% for men, and first-class passengers experiencing 63% survival rates versus 24% for third-class passengers. The project utilized advanced feature engineering to create meaningful categorical variables such as age groups and fare brackets, complemented by sophisticated visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib to communicate complex insights effectively.

**Advanced Data Visualization Portfolio**
Developed comprehensive visualization capabilities through progressive skill building, from basic statistical plots to complex multi-dimensional analysis. Mastered technical implementation of percentage formatting, correlation heatmaps, and multi-panel categorical plots that reveal nuanced patterns in data. The visualization work demonstrated the ability to identify and communicate the most impactful findings, such as discovering that even the poorest women passengers had better survival rates than the wealthiest men, illustrating sophisticated analytical thinking and storytelling capabilities.

**Machine Learning Workshop Series**
Participating in hands-on workshops focusing on practical ML implementation, including supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, model optimization, and real-world case studies.

**Upcoming Projects:**
- Advanced ensemble model implementations
- Neural network architectures for complex data patterns
- Transformer-based applications for natural language processing
- Full-stack ML application with GenAI integration
- Comprehensive capstone project demonstrating end-to-end ML pipeline
